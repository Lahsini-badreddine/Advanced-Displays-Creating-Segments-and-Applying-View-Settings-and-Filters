# Advanced-Displays-Creating-Segments-and-Applying-View-Settings-and-Filters

In this project, the key goal will be to get a strong grasp of the wide array of reports available in Google Analytics, and what types of insights they offer.

The project has three parts :  

## Part One: Primary Views and Filters

  An industry best practice is to ensure that there are three different views for whatever property you are working in:
    unfiltered (all the data, never mess with it)
    test (where you can try things out before making them live)
    working (where you’ll implement your work once it’s been tested and it’s getting the results you want)
    (This is a best practice and should be applied to any Google Analytics property you're working with.)

## Part Two: Data Exploration

Using the best practices above, explore the data and form questions.

1. Start in the Overview Report in each of these GA Reporting Areas: Audience, Acquisition, Behavior, & Conversion. Formulate questions that come to mind for each section, taking screenshots to help illustrate your questions. Also, make note of the path you take - when looking at one set of data, what question came to mind, and what did you do to try and answer it?

2. Change the default display of some standard reports in each of the GA Reporting Areas: Audience, Acquisition, Behavior, & Conversion, from Data to the following displays: Performance, Percentage, Comparison, and Pivot. Do any of these displays answer questions, provide insight, or require follow-up? Make notes to communicate what you find and again, take screenshots to demonstrate what your exploration.

## Part Three: Segmentation

Using the technique of segmentation, attempt to answer the questions posed in part two. Based on your questions, identify and show three different audience segments that could help to answer the question(s)

* One based on audience characteristic (such as technology or demographics)
* One based on geography
* One based on user behavior
